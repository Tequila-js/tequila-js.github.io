## Welcome to Tequila website

We're a team in Guadalajara, Jalisco excited to learn new stuff, this is our site, we use it to manage our knowledge, maybe this can be useful to you, maybe not, but we're here to code.

# Coding Dojos
A Coding Dojo is a periodic meeting (_usually weekly_) organized around a programming challenge where people are encouraged to participate and share their coding skills while solving the problem.
